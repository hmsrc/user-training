The `requirements.txt` file in this directory contains all the packages
that are installed into the training virtual environment that was used
to teach this workshop. If you would like to create a copy of this
virtual environment for your own uses (e.g., to step through the
accompanying notebook on your own time), you can set up a copy of this
environment with the following instructions (on O2):

module load gcc/9.2.0 python/3.9.14
virtualenv /path/to/trainingvenv
source /path/to/trainingvenv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

where `/path/to` is wherever you choose to put the virtual environment
and `requirements.txt` file (it must be downloaded or cloned into O2 before
you can follow these instructions).

If you are trying to create this environment in a location not on O2,
consult whatever documentation is associated with your local python
installation in order to set up the virtual environment with this
`requirements.txt` file.
